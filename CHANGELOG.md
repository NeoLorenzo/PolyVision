# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Preflight-002] - 2026-05-04

### Added (Async + Benchmark)
- Added dependency lock file at repository root:
  - `requirements-lock.txt` (captured via `python -m pip freeze`)
  - records exact package versions used in the validated local run environment
- Updated `docs/TRAINING.md` with:
  - preflight sanity command for async PPO smoke run
  - recommended `requirements-lock.txt` workflow for reproducibility

### Validation
- Completed short end-to-end async PPO sanity run:
  - command: `python py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py --total-timesteps 6144 --num-steps 64 --no-track --no-capture-video --startup-jitter-min-s 0.1 --startup-jitter-max-s 2.0`
  - result: exit code `0`
  - observed SPS progression: `766 -> 1192`
- Completed JVM orphan-process cleanup check around training run:
  - captured Java PIDs before and after run
  - result: `JAVA_NEW=` (no new lingering Java process IDs after `envs.close()`)
- Confirmed warnings cleanup from Tyro typing updates:
  - no `wandb_entity` / `target_kl` None-type parser warnings in sanity run after `Optional[...]` fix

### Added
- Added `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/benchmark_async_vector_envs.py`:
  - runs a quick throughput matrix for `num_envs` in `[12, 16, 20]`
  - executes `ppo.py` with Async settings and startup jitter
  - parses `SPS` output and reports `tail_avg_sps`, `all_avg_sps`, and `peak_sps`
  - auto-sets `POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=0` for cleaner benchmark logs

### Changed
- Updated `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py` to use true parallel stepping:
  - replaced `gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv(...)` with `gym.vector.AsyncVectorEnv(...)`
  - configured multiprocessing context as `context="spawn"` for Windows-safe worker startup
- Added randomized startup jitter in `ppo.py` env factory to reduce JVM launch storms:
  - each worker sleeps a random delay before creating the env
  - default jitter range: `0.1s` to `2.0s`
  - exposed as CLI args:
    - `--startup-jitter-min-s`
    - `--startup-jitter-max-s`
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py` reset logging behavior:
  - `Reset: Available actions = ...` now prints only when `POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=1`
  - default behavior is quiet (`POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=0`)
- Fixed Windows JVM classpath joining in `pol_env/Tribes/py/gym_env.py`:
  - replaced hardcoded `":"` separator with `os.pathsep`
  - resolves `JavaPackage object is not callable` startup failure when loading `core.game.PythonEnv` on Windows
- Updated `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py` defaults and typing:
  - changed `Args.num_envs` default from `4` to `12` for Phase 1 local throughput
  - changed `Args.wandb_entity` to `Optional[str]`
  - changed `Args.target_kl` to `Optional[float]`
  - removes Tyro warnings caused by `None` defaults on non-optional typed fields

### Benchmark
- Executed async throughput benchmark (`py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/benchmark_async_vector_envs.py`) on 2026-05-04 with:
  - `AsyncVectorEnv(context="spawn")`
  - startup jitter `0.1s` to `2.0s`
  - `num_envs` in `[12, 16, 20]`
- Results:
  - `num_envs=12`: `tail_avg_sps=1561`, `all_avg_sps=1377`, `peak_sps=1596`
  - `num_envs=16`: `tail_avg_sps=1172`, `all_avg_sps=1097`, `peak_sps=1194`
  - `num_envs=20`: `tail_avg_sps=1058`, `all_avg_sps=937`, `peak_sps=1117`
- Justification for defaulting to `num_envs=12`:
  - best sustained throughput (`tail_avg_sps`) and best peak SPS in benchmark
  - higher env counts degraded throughput due JVM/process overhead in this architecture

## [Preflight-001] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Created `docs/PLAIN_ENGLISH_GUIDE.md`, a non-technical overview covering:
  - how the codebase works in plain English
  - project goals and phased direction
  - practical steps for designing and training a custom model
- Created `docs/ENVIRONMENT_API.md` with documented contracts for:
  - `TribesGymEnv` reset/step/render/list_actions/close behavior
  - `TribesGymWrapper` observation flattening, action handling, and Gymnasium tuple shape
  - current reward composition and runtime notes
- Created `docs/MVP_PHASE1_SPEC.md` defining Phase 1 constraints and acceptance criteria.
- Created `docs/TESTING.md` with ordered smoke-test workflow and troubleshooting.
- Created `docs/TRAINING.md` with baseline/custom training commands and evaluation entrypoints.
- Added upstream attribution sections to:
  - `README.md`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/README.md`

### Changed
- Reworked root `README.md` into the canonical project entrypoint with:
  - docs navigation map
  - quickstart (compile, venv, install, smoke run)
  - explicit headless runtime expectation note
  - current scope statement for Phase 1 status
- Consolidated high-level project vision into `README.md` as canonical source, including:
  - project vision statement
  - Phase 1 MVP framing
  - architecture/tech stack summary
  - multi-phase roadmap
  - immediate next steps
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/README.md` to explicitly defer canonical project docs to root `README.md` + `docs/`.
- Expanded root `.gitignore` to cover local runtime artifacts:
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_*.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/game_recording_*.mp4`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/py/polytopia_simulator.log`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/game_moves_*.json`
  - `.DS_Store`
  - `*.py[cod]`

### Fixed
- Removed unused `torch` import from `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py`, resolving fresh-setup failure in `test_simple.py` (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'`).

### Removed
- Removed generated/accidental artifacts from tracked workspace files:
  - `pol_env/.DS_Store`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/game_recording_20250914_041435.mp4`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_0.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_1.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_2.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_3.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/img_step_4.png`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/py/polytopia_simulator.log`
  - `py_rl/cleanrl/=0.10.9.7`
- Removed `polyvision_plan.md` after consolidating high-level vision/roadmap ownership into `README.md`.

### Validation
- Verified runner execution:
  - `python pol_env/Tribes/py/run_gym.py` -> exit code `0`
  - `cd pol_env/Tribes/py && python run_gym.py` -> exit code `0`
- Verified smoke test after fixes:
  - `python test_simple.py` -> successful run
- Verified expected headless behavior:
  - Java GUI warning (`HeadlessException` / missing `DISPLAY`) may appear while simulation continues.
