All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Phase1-Stability-002] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Added masked-action support to PPO policy sampling in `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py`:
  - `Agent.get_action_and_value(..., action_mask=...)` now accepts a mask tensor
  - invalid action logits are set to `-1e8` before `Categorical(...)`
  - prevents policy entropy/gradient pollution from illegal actions
- Added vector-info action-mask extraction utility in PPO:
  - reads `infos["action_mask"]` and optional `infos["_action_mask"]`
  - falls back to all-valid mask when absent
- Added Phase 1 diagnostic telemetry in PPO for dashboard debugging:
  - `charts/mean_valid_actions`
  - `charts/non_endturn_rate`
  - `charts/mean_delta_spt`
  - `charts/episode_end_spt`
- Added Java level generation helper tooling for fixed-map workflows:
  - `pol_env/Tribes/src/core/levelgen/GenerateLevelCli.java`
  - `pol_env/Tribes/py/generate_fixed_map.py`
  - enables seed-based map generation and freezing to CSV for reproducible training

### Changed
- Updated PPO rollout loop to feed action masks into action sampling:
  - initializes mask from `envs.reset(...)->infos`
  - refreshes mask every step from `envs.step(...)->infos`
- Added deterministic Bardur Turn-0 heuristic opening in `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py`:
  - on reset, executes:
    - `RESOURCE_GATHERING` (ANIMAL) x2
    - `LEVEL_UP` with `WORKSHOP`
  - agent starts from post-opening state (economy head start)
  - reset now fails fast with explicit errors if expected opening actions are unavailable
- Consolidated training map set to a single fixed CSV:
  - retained only `pol_env/Tribes/levels/phase1_12x12_2bardur.csv`
  - removed all other map CSVs under `pol_env/Tribes/levels/`
- Updated Phase 1 wrapper default map:
  - `PHASE1_LEVEL_FILE` now points to `levels/phase1_12x12_2bardur.csv`
- Updated economic action whitelist in `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py`:
  - added `CAPTURE` so village settlement/city capture can be chosen by policy

### Current Training Observation
- Current long-run behavior still plateaus near `SPT = 4` by Turn 10:
  - `charts/episode_end_spt` flat around 4
  - `charts/mean_delta_spt` flat around 0
  - `charts/non_endturn_rate` decreases over training despite legal action count rising
- Interpretation:
  - the policy is not yet converting exploration/movement into economy growth within the 10-turn horizon
  - additional iteration on map layout, horizon pressure, and policy exploration is still needed

## [Phase1-MVP-001] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Added strict Phase 1 level file:
  - `pol_env/Tribes/levels/phase1_bardur_drylands.csv`
  - Bardur capital (`c:2`) plus a distant dummy enemy capital (`c:1`) to keep Java game state alive
  - drylands-style terrain only (no shallow/deep water tiles)
- Added quick verification script:
  - `test_phase1_constraints.py`
  - validates turn-10 truncation and whitelist-constrained action execution
- Added custom PPO telemetry in `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py`:
  - logs `charts/custom_spt_return` from `infos["spt"]` whenever an env episode ends (`truncations` or `terminations`)
  - fallback extraction from `infos["final_info"][env_idx]["spt"]` when direct vector key is unavailable
- Added explicit model checkpoint options to PPO CLI:
  - `--save-model`
  - `--model-path`
  - saves `agent.state_dict()` at end of training
- Added periodic checkpointing controls to PPO CLI:
  - `--save-frequency` (default: `500000`)
  - when `--save-model` is enabled, checkpoint files are written during training as:
    - `runs/<run_name>/model_checkpoint_<global_step>.cleanrl_model`
  - final model save remains:
    - `runs/<run_name>/ppo.cleanrl_model` (or custom `--model-path`)

### Changed
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py` to enforce strict Phase 1 wrapper constraints:
  - default level file now `levels/phase1_bardur_drylands.csv`
  - added whitelist filter for legal action types:
    - `END_TURN`, `MOVE`, `EXAMINE`, `RESOURCE_GATHERING`, `CLEAR_FOREST`,
      `GROW_FOREST`, `LEVEL_UP`, `RESEARCH_TECH`, `BUILD`
  - action remapping now uses whitelist-index -> raw Java action index mapping
  - added per-step action mask (`info["action_mask"]`) and action debug metadata
  - added wrapper turn counter based on executed `END_TURN` actions
  - `step()` now returns `truncated=True` when turn counter reaches 10 (unless already terminated)
  - added Phase 1 terminal override in `step()`:
    - Java `done` is ignored (`terminated=False` always in wrapper output)
    - horizon control is Python-only via `truncated=(turn_count >= 10)`
    - debug metadata includes `info["java_done"]` and `info["terminated_overridden"]`
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/py/gym_env.py` reward logic:
  - removed prior score/relative/terminal shaping
  - reward is now dense absolute Stars-Per-Turn (SPT), computed from observation city production
  - added `info["spt"]` and `info["delta_spt"]`
- Updated strict Phase 1 level to prevent immediate Java single-player game-over:
  - `phase1_bardur_drylands.csv` now includes a distant dummy enemy capital (`c:1`)
  - keeps Java state alive while Python controls episode horizon
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py` fail-fast behavior:
  - removed synthetic `NO_OP` fallback path
  - wrapper now raises `RuntimeError` when Java returns zero legal actions

### Validation
- Ran smoke test:
  - `python py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py --env-id Tribes-v0 --num-envs 4 --total-timesteps 4096 --no-track --save-model`
  - output included `model_saved=runs\Tribes-v0__ppo__1__1777901078\ppo.cleanrl_model`
- Verified TensorBoard event tags in smoke run:
  - `charts/custom_spt_return` present with 149 scalar points
  - confirms custom SPT telemetry is being emitted even when default episodic stats are absent

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/TRAINING.md` with:
  - checkpointing usage for long runs
  - tracked 5,000,000-step launch command with online W&B sync

## [Preflight-002] - 2026-05-04

### Added (Async + Benchmark)
- Added dependency lock file at repository root:
  - `requirements-lock.txt` (captured via `python -m pip freeze`)
  - records exact package versions used in the validated local run environment
- Updated `docs/TRAINING.md` with:
  - preflight sanity command for async PPO smoke run
  - recommended `requirements-lock.txt` workflow for reproducibility

### Validation
- Completed short end-to-end async PPO sanity run:
  - command: `python py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py --total-timesteps 6144 --num-steps 64 --no-track --no-capture-video --startup-jitter-min-s 0.1 --startup-jitter-max-s 2.0`
  - result: exit code `0`
  - observed SPS progression: `766 -> 1192`
- Completed JVM orphan-process cleanup check around training run:
  - captured Java PIDs before and after run
  - result: `JAVA_NEW=` (no new lingering Java process IDs after `envs.close()`)
- Confirmed warnings cleanup from Tyro typing updates:
  - no `wandb_entity` / `target_kl` None-type parser warnings in sanity run after `Optional[...]` fix

### Added
- Added `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/benchmark_async_vector_envs.py`:
  - runs a quick throughput matrix for `num_envs` in `[12, 16, 20]`
  - executes `ppo.py` with Async settings and startup jitter
  - parses `SPS` output and reports `tail_avg_sps`, `all_avg_sps`, and `peak_sps`
  - auto-sets `POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=0` for cleaner benchmark logs

### Changed
- Updated `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py` to use true parallel stepping:
  - replaced `gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv(...)` with `gym.vector.AsyncVectorEnv(...)`
  - configured multiprocessing context as `context="spawn"` for Windows-safe worker startup
- Added randomized startup jitter in `ppo.py` env factory to reduce JVM launch storms:
  - each worker sleeps a random delay before creating the env
  - default jitter range: `0.1s` to `2.0s`
  - exposed as CLI args:
    - `--startup-jitter-min-s`
    - `--startup-jitter-max-s`
- Updated `pol_env/Tribes/py/register_env.py` reset logging behavior:
  - `Reset: Available actions = ...` now prints only when `POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=1`
  - default behavior is quiet (`POLYVISION_VERBOSE_RESETS=0`)
- Fixed Windows JVM classpath joining in `pol_env/Tribes/py/gym_env.py`:
  - replaced hardcoded `":"` separator with `os.pathsep`
  - resolves `JavaPackage object is not callable` startup failure when loading `core.game.PythonEnv` on Windows
- Updated `py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/ppo.py` defaults and typing:
  - changed `Args.num_envs` default from `4` to `12` for Phase 1 local throughput
  - changed `Args.wandb_entity` to `Optional[str]`
  - changed `Args.target_kl` to `Optional[float]`
  - removes Tyro warnings caused by `None` defaults on non-optional typed fields

### Benchmark
- Executed async throughput benchmark (`py_rl/cleanrl/cleanrl/benchmark_async_vector_envs.py`) on 2026-05-04 with:
  - `AsyncVectorEnv(context="spawn")`
  - startup jitter `0.1s` to `2.0s`
  - `num_envs` in `[12, 16, 20]`
- Results:
  - `num_envs=12`: `tail_avg_sps=1561`, `all_avg_sps=1377`, `peak_sps=1596`
  - `num_envs=16`: `tail_avg_sps=1172`, `all_avg_sps=1097`, `peak_sps=1194`
  - `num_envs=20`: `tail_avg_sps=1058`, `all_avg_sps=937`, `peak_sps=1117`
- Justification for defaulting to `num_envs=12`:
  - best sustained throughput (`tail_avg_sps`) and best peak SPS in benchmark
  - higher env counts degraded throughput due JVM/process overhead in this architecture
